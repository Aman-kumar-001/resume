        Organizations (VOs)/ Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to Sign Up on the Portal.VOs/NGOs play a major role
        in the development of the nation by supplementing the efforts of the Government. This portal enables VOs/NGOs to
        enrol centrally and thus facilitates creation of a repository of information about VOs/NGOs, Sector/State wise.
        The Portal facilitates VOs/NGOs to obtain a system generated Unique ID, as and when signed. The Unique ID is
        mandatory to apply for grants under various schemes of Ministries/Departments/Governments Bodies.
