            <h3>About:--</h3>

            <p>
                In the early years of the great Indian economic liberalisation when India had stepped on the economic
                accelerator and multiple waves of transformation were sweeping across its states, a young, first-
                generation entrepreneur, Padma Shri Rajinder Gupta, sowed the first seeds of industry on the fertile
                lands of Punjab. It was the birth of Trident Group.

                The group began with a solitary unit making high-quality yarn. However, in due course, the group
                catapulted to become the largest manufacturer of terry towels and one of the largest integrated home
                textile manufacturers in the world; a feat nonpareil.

            <p>
                Today, we have travelled far beyond being a home textile manufacturer, by successfully diversifying into
                paper, chemicals, energy and more.

                From Punjab to the homes of millions of customers across 100 countries, Trident is on a verge of
                becoming
                the most trusted brand that takes conscious care of its customers, employees and all stakeholders, and
                treats them the best.

                It takes vision to grow into a billion-dollar company in just three decades. It takes persistence to
                make a mark on a global scale in a domain that embodies fierce competition. It takes creativity to
                design a range of products that are celebrated the world over. It takes foresight to build trailblazing
                infrastructure that can scale and support growth. It takes sensitivity to care for the community â€“ its
                health, its education, and its empowerment.

                We have what it takes.</p>
